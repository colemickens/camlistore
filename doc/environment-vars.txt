The standard library's strconv.ParseBool() is used to parse boolean environment
variables.  It accepts 1, t, T, TRUE, true, True, 0, f, F, FALSE, false,
False. Any other value is an implicit false.

For integer values, strconv.Atoi() is used which means only base 10 numbers are
valid.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (string):
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET (string):
  See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fws/1.1/GettingStartedGuide/index.html?AWSCredentials.html
  Used in s3 tests.  If not set some tests are skip.  If set, queries will be
  sent to Amazon's S3 service.

CAMLI_AUTH (string):
  See http://camlistore.org/docs/server-config
  Used as a fallback in pkg/client.Client (except on android) when
  configuration files lack and 'auth' entry.  If a client is using the -server
  commandline to specify the camlistore instance to talk to, this env var
  takes precedence over that specified in the configuration files.

CAMLI_BASEURL (string):
  URL set in devcam to act as a baseURL in the devcam launched camlistored.

CAMLI_CACHE_DIR (string):
  Path used by pkg/osutil to override operating system specific cache
  directory.

CAMLI_CONFIG_DIR (string):
  Path used by pkg/osutil to override operating system specific configuration
  directory.

CAMLI_DBNAME (string):
  Backend specific data source name (DSN).
  Set in devcam to pass database configuration for the indexer to the devcam
  launched camlistored.

CAMLI_DEBUG (bool):
  Used by camlistored and camput to enable additional commandline options.
  Used in pkg/schema to enable additional logging.

CAMLI_DEBUG_CONFIG (bool):
  Causes pkg/serverconfig to dump low-level configuration derived from
  high-level configuation on load.

CAMLI_DEBUG_UPLOADS (bool):
  Used by pkg/client to enable additional logging.

CAMLI_DEV_CAMLI_ROOT (string):
  If set, the base directory of Camlistore when in dev mode.
  Used by pkg/server for finding static assests (js, css, html).
  Used as a signal by pkg/index/* and pkg/server to output more helpful error
  message when run under devcam.

CAMLI_DEV_CLOSURE_DIR (string):
  Path override for pkg/server. If specified, this path will be used to serve
  the closure handler.

CAMLI_DEV_KEYBLOBS (string):
  Path to keyblobs directory.
  Used by pkg/client to override 'selfPubKeyDir' value in configuration files.

CAMLI_HTTP_DEBUG (bool):
  Enable per-request logging in pkg/webserver.

CAMLI_HTTP_EXPVAR (bool):
  Enable json export of expvars at /debug/vars

CAMLI_HTTP_PPROF (bool):
  Enable standard library's pprof handler at /debug/pprof/

CAMLI_IGNORED_FILES (string):
  Override client configuration option 'ignoredFiles'.
  Comma-seperated list of files to be ignored by pkg/client when uploading
  with -filenodes.

CAMLI_INCLUDE_PATH (string):
  Path to search for files.
  Referenced in pkg/osutil and used indirectly by pkg/jsonconfig.ConfigParser
  to search for files mentioned in configurations.  This is used as a last
  resort after first checking the current directory and the camlistore config
  directory. It should be in the OS path form, i.e. unix-like systems would be
  /path/1:/path/two:/some/other/path, and Windows would be C:\path\one;D:\path\2

CAMLI_KEYID (string):
  devcam commands only, used by config/dev-server-config.json, and
  config/dev-client-dir/client-config.json: public ID of the GPG key
  to use for signing.

CAMLI_MONGO_WIPE (bool):
  Wipe out mongo based index on startup.

CAMLI_NO_FILE_DUP_SEARCH (bool):
  This will cause the search-for-exists-before-upload step to be skipped when
  camput is uploading files.

CAMLI_QUIET (bool):
  Used by devcam to enable -verbose flag for camput/camget.

CAMLI_SECRET_RING (string):
  Path to the GPG secret keyring, which is otherwise set by identitySecretRing
  in the server config, and secretRing in the client config.

CAMLI_TRACK_FS_STATS (bool):
  Enable operation counts for fuse filesystem.

CAMLI_TRUSTED_CERT (string):
  Override client configuration option 'trustedCerts'.
  Comma-seperated list of paths to trusted certificate fingerprints.

CAMPUT_ANDROID_OUTPUT (bool):
  Enable pkg/client status messages to print to stdout. Used in android client.

CAM_DEBUG_IMAGES (bool):
  Enable extra debugging in pkg/images when decoding images.  Used by indexers.

DEV_THROTTLE_KBPS (integer):
DEV_THROTTLE_LATENCY_MS (integer):
  Rate limit and/or inject latency in pkg/webserver responses. A value of 0
  disables traffic-shaping.
