- Show a placeholder item while an upload is in progress.
- Hook through upload progress percentage from the camli javascript
  API to the upload placeholder item.
- Add dragdrop of selected blobs to put them in sets?
- Make images a few stops bigger by default
- Fix resample quality - looks pretty crappy right now
- Get better folder/file icons
- Can we put the name of the folder/file within the icon?
- Permanode functionality is just weird... do we need this in the main
  UI? should be a command-line only thing I think
- Add support for uploading entire folders
- Make the toolbar a Medium/Quip style floating thing - get temporary
  icons from the noun project
- Infinite scroll
  - bonus: some cool effect as items load!
